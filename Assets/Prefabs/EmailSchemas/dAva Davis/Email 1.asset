  subject: Regarding the death of Ava Davis
  body: Our competitor, Zenith, lost an employee today. We picked up some strangeness
    on our cameras conviently place near their windows. First, our team saw a group
    of employees carrying a casket out the door. Next, they closed the feed because
    they were really creeped out. We can't help but think that the circumstances
    of her death are unusual.
