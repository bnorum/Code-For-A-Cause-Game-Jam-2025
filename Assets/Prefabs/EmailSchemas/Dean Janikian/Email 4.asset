  subject: RIP Dean Janikian
  body: Dean Janikian was a business partner of the magazine for decades. The deal
    was, he'd give us donuts for our weekly stand-ups, and in exchange we'd commission
    an artist to make him a chair once a year. Good deal, and the donuts were always
    good. We support his entrance into Heaven.
