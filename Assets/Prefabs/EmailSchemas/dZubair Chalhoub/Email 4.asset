  subject: Worry I accidentally killed customer
  body: I'm a bat salesman, and I kinda struggle with organizing my stock. My client,
    Zubair Chalhoub, came in last week to by one of my under-the-counter extra-large
    bats. Unfortunately, I didn't notice and reached under those, giving him my under-under-the-counter
    extra-large mega-poisonous bats. Whoops.
