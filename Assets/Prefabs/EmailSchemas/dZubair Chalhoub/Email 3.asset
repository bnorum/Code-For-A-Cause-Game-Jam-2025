  subject: Cricket Explaination
  body: Hi! My friend Shiv told me to reach out. He asked if I could explain Cricket
    to help you understand the case of Zubair. Basically, it's completely unrealistic
    for a batter to have over a 0.5 batting average. Even the best in the world have
    less than that. In a rec league, it's very hard to score a lot of runs, keep
    a lookout if a player has over a couple hundred. It's easy to cheat in Cricket,
    you just bring a bigger bat. Guy W. E. Cricket, out.
