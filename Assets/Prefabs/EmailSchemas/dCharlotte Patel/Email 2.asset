  subject: One last thing
  body: SCHEDULED EMAIL:\n\nBad news, my parachute just failed. Good news, I just
    got an email that said my Charlane Papi tickets got refunded! Maybe if she didn't
    make them so expensive, she wouldn't have died. Karma, right. Anyway, I gotta
    get back to falling now.
