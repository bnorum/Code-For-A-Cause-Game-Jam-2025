  subject: For Virgil's sake
  body: 16 years ago, my dreams of moving to America were crushed, as the final days
    of my work visa neared. I looked for solutions online, and came across a man
    called Virgil. Virgil was happy to marry me free of charge, so that I could get
    a green card. Today, I was sending my weekly text to thank him, and saw his number
    was dead. If he's down there, I'm putting in a good word.
