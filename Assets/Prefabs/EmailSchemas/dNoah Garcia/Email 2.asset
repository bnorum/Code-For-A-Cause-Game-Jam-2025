  subject: Dramatic Retelling of Wild West Duel
  body: Garcia stood west of the tavern, Vega stood east. At the crack of dawn, the
    combatants raised their firearms. For Garcia, his trusty revolver. For Vega,
    a silenced M4-A1 with a bump stock and a red dot. The combatants raised their
    weapons. One man fell, the other turned and left.
