  subject: Duel In the Wild West
  body: The battle between Sheriff Noah Garcia and "Flipping" Sal Vega began at the
    crack of dawn. We haven't looked outside yet. I just know the Sheriff will win,
    but if he doesn't he deserves to go to Heaven, he's a treasure. And that "Flipping"
    Sal, he's terrorized our saloon for years, Hell would be lucky to have him.
