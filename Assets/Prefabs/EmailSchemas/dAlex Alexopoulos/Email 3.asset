  subject: Yeah It's True
  body: If you haven't heard already, yes I made a deal with Alexopoulos. No I don't
    really want him here. He's kind of annoying, honestly. I just gave him the deal
    to shut him up. Humans, man. They aren't on demon time. Anyway I'm your boss,
    send him to Heaven. That's an order!
