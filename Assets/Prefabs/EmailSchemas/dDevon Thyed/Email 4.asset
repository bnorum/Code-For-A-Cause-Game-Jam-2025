  subject: Our Greatest Customer
  body: We noticed a tank in our stocks last night, and quickly assessed the situation.
    Turns out, Devon Thyed, our biggest customer, had died. We had a special phone
    in the office for just his calls. The white jean business will never be the same
    without him.
