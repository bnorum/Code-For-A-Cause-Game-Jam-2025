  subject: Virgil
  body: Virgil was strange. I met him when he married my Romanian roommate, Mica.
    He was so old, sometimes he would forget to respond to his own name. They were
    50 years apart. It was weird. Then he was just gone one day. Mica ended up with
    a green card out of it though.
