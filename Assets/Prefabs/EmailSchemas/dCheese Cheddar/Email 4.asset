  subject: Mouse Death Inquiry
  body: Hello,\n\nAt Zenith, we are constantly looking for new ways to advance science.
    We've been parsing the web for upsurges of the term  "mouse death," and noticed
    a hotspot in your inbox. If you could give us the contact info of the building
    owner, we'd appreciate you help to advance science!
